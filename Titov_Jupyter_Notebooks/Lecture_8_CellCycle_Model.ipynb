Unfortunately, we don't have time to review *dynamic system theory* as whole class can be dedicated to it but if you want to learn a lot more about these types of analyses you can read this introductory textbook \"Steven H.

The method to determine the stability of fixed point for nonlinear systems of ODE involves calculating eigenvalues, traces and determinants of Jacobians. For example, if the trace of the Jacobian at a given fixed point is positive then fixed point is unstable and if negative - stable. If eigenvalues are complex numbers then the fixed points are spirals or circles. Several other similar rules exist that you can read about and see their derivation in above textbook."
